Jujuan's video was probably one of the most complex shots we've done so far. A big part of our limitations is sticking to our 100ft power chord. Walking backwards with a shoulder mounted camera is hard enough but navigating through a hallway, through doors, and down stairs only adds to it. Jujuan was way more up for the task than we were.
