On the set of Jay Boogie's TIMESPENT he kept telling us about his friend NYC SPELL. A couple of months later we met up with NYC SPELL in Brooklyn. Spell and a few of his friends took us to a random apartment complex in Brooklyn. He said he had been obsessing over doing a video in the elevator there and assured us he knew the Super. For the record we started from the bottom, and the building Super didn't care.
