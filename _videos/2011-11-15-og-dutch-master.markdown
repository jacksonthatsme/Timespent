TIME SPENT is all about meeting new artist and finding new locations. Going back to the Leopard Opera video we shot in PedX, we ran into Tony V working the counter. Leopard Opera also recommended Tony to us. After we finished our shot we made contacts with Tony and planned the shoot with him and Jujuan.
