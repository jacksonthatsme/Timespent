NY can be a loud place so we brought on a sound mixer to mic the performances. The connection for ABDU came from our sound guy Brian who was already working on a music video with ABDU. We decided on this location after finding that every park in the area was crowded with screaming children, the only issue was the occasional car. ABDU has to be one of the most direct and energetic artists we've worked with and can't wait to do another!
