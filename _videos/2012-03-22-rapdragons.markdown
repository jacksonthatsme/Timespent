Greg and Nick are still probably the two coolest people that Time Spent has introduced us to. On this shoot they thought we should incorporate the Charles Theatre as a Baltimore icon and we thought that was perfect. Also, Greg works there so that made things easy. The room we chose is the rarely seen upstairs projection room starting at one of the film reels and ending up at the balcony overlooking the entrance. You can find RapDragons music online or just go say hey to Greg the next time youâ€™re at the movies.
