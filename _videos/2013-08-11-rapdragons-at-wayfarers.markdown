On July 26th 2013, TIME SPENT hosted their first live show with the help of Wayfarers Studios in Brooklyn, NY. At the event, RAPDRAGONS and Disturbed Individuals put on an incredible a cappella set followed by a full live show set. Greg Ward and Nick Often took the stage after completing their second TIME SPENT video starting in the streets of Bushwick and ending in the gallery. A truly incredible night shared with some of the most talented people we know.
