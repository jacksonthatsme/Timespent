Nick Often also raps for Rap Dragons with Greg Ward. Keeping their styles similar we shot Nick in his apartment which doubles as their recording studio. Normally we'd expect to find an old soul album on the turntable with the intentions of chopping it into a beat. Here we found a Future Islands 7" and a stack of other local Baltimore artists. An interesting thing about Nick is how soft spoken he can be in conversation but how aggressive he becomes while rapping. This is something we've been waiting to find.
