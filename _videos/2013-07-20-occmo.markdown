After our shoot with RapDragons we asked who we should shoot next. They said they hate everyone, but they like Disturbed Individuals. Sterling is the first member of DI we shot and we met up at his new place. However, our shoot was delayed an hour because we discovered Sterling has an MPC in his DJ set up and ended just hanging out and making music. This is exactly why we do this.
