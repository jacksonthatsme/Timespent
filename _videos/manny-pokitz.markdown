When we shot our TIME SPENT with Atarashii Kein he drove us around Baltimore and introduced us to a few artists. We got to spend the day with Slum Paradise's Manny Pokitz and Nick Perkins. Here is Richmond's Manny Pokitz performing in a Copycat building elevator. Next up we have a TIME SPENT with Nick Perkins
