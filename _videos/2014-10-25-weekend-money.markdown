Duo Weekend Money consist of emcee Ne$$ & producer Baghdaddy. We connected via TIMESPENT alum Fat Tony shortly after our J train shoot. We met up at Baghdaddy's studio in Dumbo where the place is filled to the brim with instruments and potential sound producing objects. It was a real treat to watch their creative process together with Baghdaddy recording sound from found objects and Ne$$ prepping his pace for the video. Be very, very excited for new Weekend Money... also shoutout to .BIZ
