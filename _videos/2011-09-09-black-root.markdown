Black Root (Jamaal Collier) raps with Wordslave in Axiom. For Black Root's video we decided to shoot on park avenue with our extension chord running out of the car. Root brought along his son so we decided a nice stroll through the park would be the perfect scene. Catch the time spent shout out at the end (ad-libbed on the spot).
