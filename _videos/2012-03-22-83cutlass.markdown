We feel that in our collection of videos we have covered a pretty diverse set of MD and VA artists. It is rare though that we come across such direct and potent lyrics like those of 83Cutlass (Chad). If you ever get a chance to sit down with Chad ask him to tell you a crazy story about Bmore, he has a hundred of them and they’re all great. Also, the location he chose is something we didn’t even know existed in the city, an urban farm. We started at a patch of carrots and ended up on North Ave, the strangest reveal yet.
