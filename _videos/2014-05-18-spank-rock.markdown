Baltimore Hero and Philly local MC Spank Rock has been a long time TIMESPENT favorite (8+ years). We first met Naeem when we interviewed him for the Baltimore publication The Lions Mansion. Two years later we crossed paths again in Bmore, his home town, at the Metro Gallery where he performed some new work. - GULLY is out now, get ready for what's to follow.
