We often run into the issue of pitching the TIME SPENT format in the right way. When we met Joel we started to explain the manifesto and he cut us off. He was ready the next day to shoot. Our first attempt was stopped mid way via NYPD but after a soft warning and a quick relocation we give you JAY BOOGIE at Grand Central.
