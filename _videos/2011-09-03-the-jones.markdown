Jordan is a 21 year old illustration major at the Maryland Institute College of Art and raps with Moe in Leopard Opera. After searching the inner harbor for a working outlet to power our camera, we finally came across the MTA metro and started to shoot. After a few takes we got hassled by an MTA officer but thankfully we were able to get a few more takes before being kicked out. We plan on returning soon.
