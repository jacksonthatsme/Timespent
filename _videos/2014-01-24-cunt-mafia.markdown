If you've ever been to The Flat in Williamsburg, then chances are you've bumped into Contessa Stuto and the CUNT MAFIA crew. When we first met Cakes Da Killa he was performing at their event and we were able to meet her as well. As the cycle continued we decided to shoot both Contessa Stuto and Quay Dash as CUNT MAFIA in the lovely tucked away back room of The Flat where all things CHERRY BOMB go down. - Presented by True Laurels
