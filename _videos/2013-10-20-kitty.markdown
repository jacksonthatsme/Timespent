We met up with Kitty in Korea town and started asking shop owners if we could shoot a walk-through in their shop. After a few takes in a jewelry store the owners kicked us out for making the customers feel worried, as they claimed. So out on the street we found some nice neon window lighting and found our video. Kitty has a soft yet confident delivery easily heard over the noise of the city.
